# 🛠️ Cart Designer (Prequel Mode)

## Overview
The **Cart Designer** is the first step in your journey as a Chillista. Before you can brew, you must build. This mini-game allows you to customize your starting experience, stats, and aesthetic.

## 📐 Phase 1: Blueprint
Choose your starting archetype. This choice is permanent for the save file!

| Archetype | Pros | Cons | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Velo-Barista** (Cargo Bike) | High Mobility, Eco-Perks | Low Capacity | Environmentalists, Speed-runners |
| **Sidewalk Hacker** (Street Cart) | High Capacity, Toughness | Low Appeal | Resource hoarders, Grinders |
| **Micro-Luxe** (Trailer) | High Tips, Premium Vibe | High Cost | Min-maxers, Perfectionists |

## 🔨 Phase 2: Construction Site
Turn your blueprint into reality. This phase is interactive and features multiple construction mechanics.

### 1. Sourcing Materials
Before building, you must choose where your parts come from. This affects your starting reputation and build quality.
*   **Dumpster Dive** (Free): High risk, low quality.
*   **Generic Hardware** ($100): Standard parts.
*   **Artisan Crafted** ($500): Premium quality, high aesthetic appeal.

### 2. The Build
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Hammer! (Click)**: Rapid clicking to build progress. Consumes Energy.
    *   **Weld! (Hold)**: Hold the button to weld. Builds progress faster but generates **Heat**.
*   **Hazards**:
    *   **Overheating**: If you weld too long, the tool overheats and enforces a cooldown.
    *   **Events**: Watch for humorous flavor text events (e.g., "Ouch! Thumb!").
*   **Goal**: Reach 100% progress.

> **Mobile Tip**: On mobile devices, use the scroll feature to view all sourcing options.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Launch Pad
Finalize your business identity.
*   **Branding**: Enter a custom name for your coffee shop. This will appear in menus and dialogue.
*   **Launch**: Clicking "Launch Business" will start the main game simulation with your selected stats and Remaining Funds.

## Strategy Tips
*   **Watch your Budget**: Different blueprints have different base costs. Cheaper carts leave you with more starting cash for ingredients!
*   **Patience**: Don't spam the hammer button if you're out of energy. Wait for the recharge.
